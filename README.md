# Simulatrix

**Simulatrix** is a modular, prompt-driven simulation engine that turns text into immersive AI-powered experiences. Whether you're exploring power fantasies, personal introspection, story-based RPGs, or surreal dreamscapes, Simulatrix helps you build a world where your imagination leads — and the simulation follows.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Prompt-to-World Pipeline**: Transform natural language prompts into dynamic states, characters, and events.
- **LLM Integration**: Use any compatible large language model to simulate dialogues, narration, or unfolding scenarios.
- **Device-Agnostic Outputs**: Integrate with AR, TTS, robotics, or other hardware via modular output channels.
- **Session Memory & History**: Track user choices and story progression via structured tick-based session logging.
- **Context-Aware Evolution**: Simulations evolve with or without user input, driven by timed ticks or triggers.

## 💡 Use Cases

- Immersive storytelling  
- Self-guided therapy and visualization  
- Erotic or emotional fantasy simulation  
- Worldbuilding and prototyping interactive fiction  
- Training, roleplay, or meditative environments

## 🔧 Technologies

- Python backend (Django or FastAPI)
- Celery-based tick scheduler
- OpenAI/Local LLM support
- Optional TTS (e.g., Azure Speech) + AR integration
- Pluggable interfaces for VR/robotics

## ⚠️ Philosophy & Ethics

Simulatrix is a creative platform. We encourage responsible use that respects emotional safety, privacy, and personal boundaries — even in fantasy.
